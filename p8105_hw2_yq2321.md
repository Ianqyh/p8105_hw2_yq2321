P8105 Homework 2
================

Problem 1

The code chunk below reads and cleans Mr.Trash Wheel sheet.

``` r
trash_wheel_sheet = read_excel("hw2_data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N408") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(sports_balls = round(sports_balls))
```

The code chunk below reads and cleans precipitation data for 2018.

``` r
precipitation_2018 = read_excel("hw2_data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2018 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(year = 2018)
```

The code chunk below reads and cleans precipitation data for 2019.

``` r
precipitation_2019 = 
read_excel("hw2_data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx", sheet = "2019 Precipitation", range = "A2:B14") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(total) %>%
  mutate(year = 2019)
```

The code chunk below combines precipitation datasets and converts month
to a character variable.

``` r
precipitation_combined = bind_rows(precipitation_2018, precipitation_2019) %>%
  mutate(month = month.name[month])
```

The number of observations in the resulting Mr.Trash Wheel dataset is
344. The number of observations in the resulting combined precipitation
dataset is 18. The total precipitation in 2018 is 70.33.
